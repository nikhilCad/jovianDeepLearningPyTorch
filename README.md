LECTURE 3 and 4 mein kuch ghapla hai check karo


Tracker

✔ L1   -----------  ✔ 1     ✔ 2      ✔ 3  ---- Intro

✔ L2   -----------  ✔ 1     ✔ 2      ✔ 3  ---- Simple datasets

mnist-logical one gives wrong output for some reason giving wrong output

✔ L3   -----------  ✔ 1     ✔ 2      ✔ 3   ---- Using GPU

✔ L4   -----------  ✔ 1     ✔ 2 ---- Classifying images of everyday objects using a neural network

✔ L5   -----------  ✔ 1     ✔ 2      - 3 ----CNN,CIFAR10 images using ResNet

Part 3 needs Jovian API key, so not doing

❌ L6   -----------  ❌ 1     ❌ 2      ✔ 3 ----Generative Adverserial Networks GAN -generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset- takes very long to train
